# Online TRACS: Understanding the Notional Machine

TRACS is an educational tool that has been designed to help novice programmers improve their tracing skills in order to fully understand how a piece of code functions.

### Further development: Getting started

1. Clone the repository
2. From a terminal, navigate to the root folder of the project (cd notional-machine) and run the following
commands in order to start the client:
```
> cd client
> npm install
> npm start
```
3. From another terminal, the server can be started by navigating to the root folder again (cd notional-
machine) and running the following commands:
```
> cd server
> npm install
> npm start
```
4. To check if everything is working properly, navigate to ”http://localhost:8080” from a browser.
5. When adding data, the function of the API can be checked at ”http://localhost:3000/{resource}”, where
the resources are ”pupil”, ”exercise”, ”solution”, ”expression”, ”arrow”, ”step” and ”variable”.

All files in the repository have been documented in detail in order to facilitate further development.
